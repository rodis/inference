"""Emit the process graph — the contract that carries `processes/*.yml` to the dashboard.

ADR 0012 promises the visualization comes free: "the definition is the graph, the events are
the state". The graph half has to cross a build boundary to collect on that, and this is it.

**Why a generated file and not an import.** The dashboard image is built with `dashboard/` as
its Docker context (`publish-images.yml` declares it explicitly), so `src/reconciler/` is not
merely un-installed there — it is *outside the build context* and cannot be COPYed. The two
ways out were to widen the context to the repo root, or to project the definitions into a data
file the dashboard reads like it already reads `logical_levels.json`. This is the second,
because it keeps the tiers uncoupled: the dashboard consumes a *contract*, not a package, so it
needs neither pydantic nor pyyaml nor any knowledge of what a `signal` block means. It is also
the move this repo already makes at its other language boundary — `emit_event_schema.py` ->
`contracts/inferred_event.schema.json` -> `npm run gen:types`.

The cost is a file that can go stale, which is why `_ci-checks.yml` re-runs this and fails on a
diff. Do not hand-edit the output.

Run from the repo root:  uv run python scripts/emit_process_graph.py
Re-run whenever a `processes/*.yml` changes, and commit the result.
