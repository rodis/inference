"""Composition and scheduling (ADR 0012).

`app` is where a run gets wired; `flow.py` and `run.py` are two thin skins over it. What is
worth pinning here is the small amount of *logic* that lives at that seam — which sequence
number a new cycle takes, and which period a scheduled open covers — plus the duplication the
design could not avoid: a cron appears in the process definition AND in the runner's manifest,
and nothing but a test keeps them honest.

Since 2026-09-03 there are TWO runners (ADR 0012's amendment): Argo Workflows on the cluster
carries the frequent schedules, Prefect Cloud runs each flow once a day as an independent
backstop. So the scheduling assertions below come in pairs — what each runner owns, and the
quota ceiling that decided the split.
