"""The email todo sweep (reconciler.tasks).

The sweep is the only thing that can close a task from outside the dashboard, and it decides
that by *absence* — a task is done because Gmail no longer reports it. Deciding anything from
absence is dangerous, so most of what is pinned here is the guard rails around that inference
rather than the happy path.

No network and no database: `diff` is pure, and `sweep` takes its Gmail client and its store as
arguments.
