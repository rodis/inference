"""Telling a payment SENT from the same payment COMPLETED (ADR 0012).

The two mails below are the real ones, verbatim, from 2026-07-15 — same sender, same invoice,
2h55m apart. Nothing structural separates them, which is the entire reason this stage reads
rather than compares.

What is pinned here is the **split**: identity is decided deterministically and semantics are
decided by the classifier, in that order. A classifier that could also decide identity would be
one hallucination away from closing another invoice's stage.
