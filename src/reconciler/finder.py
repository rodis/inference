"""Resolving `await` signals (ADR 0012).

An `await` asks "has the fact this stage waits for appeared yet?". Answering it has two parts,
split here on purpose:

- **fetching candidates** — a `CandidateSource`, the only thing that touches the outside world;
- **deciding whether one satisfies the stage** — `SignalFinder`, pure and fully tested.

Every loop lives on this side. n8n is asked a question and answers it; it never notices
anything, never polls, and never decides. That split exists because the alternative — a
polling connector pushing events — put the "has it happened yet?" loop in two places, and
made "n8n is down" indistinguishable from "not approved yet". A synchronous question fails
loudly; a missing push is silent.

For a human decision there is nothing to interpret: **applying a Gmail label IS the decision**.
Classification is reserved for genuine semantic work, like telling a *submitted* payment from
a merely *processed* one.

**Where a classifier sits is load-bearing.** It runs last, after every deterministic filter, so
it is asked only about mail already known to be from the right sender and about the right
invoice — and so a run with nothing to judge costs nothing. Identity is never its job: see
`reconciler.classify`.

    Signal grammar, common to every source:

        correlate_on:     a field that must match the SAME field on a predecessor milestone,
                          which is what ties evidence to *its* cycle rather than to whichever
                          cycle happens to be open
        mentions:         the same tie, for evidence we did NOT send: the milestone value must
                          appear somewhere in the message's text
        where:            plain field equality filters, e.g. {from: accounting@dreamhost.com}
        classify:         a yes/no question a `Classifier` answers about the message
        slack_seconds:    how far before `since` to look

    **Slack is not sloppiness.** For a mail we sent ourselves, the evidence's time is the
    message's own `Date` — i.e. roughly when the approval request went out, not when the label
    was applied. So it legitimately carries a timestamp at or just before the milestone that
    triggered it, and a strict `>= since` would never match. `correlate_on` is what keeps the
    widened window safe.

    **`mentions` is `correlate_on` for mail somebody else composed.** Our own approval request
    carries the invoice number in a field, so equality works; Tipalti's notifications carry it
    in a sentence, so the tie has to be a substring test. It is still deterministic, and it is
    still what makes the widened window safe — the classifier is never asked whose invoice a
    mail is about.

    Filters run cheapest-first and the classifier runs **last**, so a reconcile that finds no
    plausible mail spends nothing on interpretation.
