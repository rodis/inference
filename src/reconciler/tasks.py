"""Email todo tasks: two events, and an hourly sweep that keeps them honest.

A task is a mail you labelled. It exists as **two raw events**, never as a mutable row:

    email_labeled_todo   the task opened   (upstream_id, from, subject, ...)
    email_task_closed    the task closed   (the same upstream_id, closed_via)

The open list is then an anti-join — labelled messages with no close for their `upstream_id` —
which is the same move the process board makes over `cycle_key`, and it needs no engine and no
session pairing. That matters: `session_window` holds exactly one open slot per (user,
definition), so it structurally cannot track a dozen concurrent tasks; ADR 0012 refused it for
process cycles for the same reason.

**Why this is a sweep and not a process.** `processes/*.yml` describes a cycle with stages and
waits, and the reconciler advances it. A task has no stages — it has two states. Modelling one
task as a process would mint a cycle per email and hand eleven-stage machinery to a two-state
thing. What the two jobs *share* is the tier's actual idea: run on a schedule, be a pure
function of the facts already recorded, and therefore be safe to re-run. This is that idea in
its second shape.

**Why the sweep is the authority, and the connector only an optimisation.** Gmail tells us a
label was *added* (the n8n Gmail Trigger polls for it, ~60s) and never that one was *removed*.
So closing cannot come from a trigger at all. The sweep asks the only question that has a
complete answer — *what is labelled right now?* — and derives both directions from it:

    labelled in Gmail, no open event   ->  emit email_labeled_todo   (a trigger we missed)
    open event, not labelled in Gmail  ->  emit email_task_closed    (done, however it was done)

That second line is what makes unlabelling on your phone work, and the first is a real repair:
the Gmail Trigger node is documented to drop messages, and `connectors/n8n/gmail-query`'s own
header records why a polling connector could not be trusted as the only witness. Being a pure
function of "now" versus "recorded" means the sweep cannot drift — there is no cursor to lose.

The dashboard's tick is the fast path for closing: it removes the label and emits the close
immediately, so the row goes away at once. The sweep then agrees with it, which is the property
worth having — two producers of the same fact that cannot disagree, because both are derived
from the label rather than from each other.
