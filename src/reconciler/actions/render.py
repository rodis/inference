"""Rendering the invoice PDF (ADR 0012).

The payload the template expects is built here and unit-tested; the HTTP call lives in
`reconciler.adapters.craftmypdf`. Same split as the approval mail, for the same reason — the
exact JSON a cycle would send can be inspected without sending anything.

CraftMyPDF is called **directly**, not through n8n. Its n8n node is a community plugin, and
the cluster has no persistence, so the plugin is lost on every pod restart. Calling the REST
API needs only an API key — no OAuth, no token refresh — so nothing here needs n8n's
credential store the way Gmail and SMTP do. It also keeps PDF rendering off n8n's egress path,
which is the currently-unreliable one (backlog #70).
