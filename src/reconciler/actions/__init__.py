"""Stage actions — the `act` implementations (ADR 0012).

An action is resolved from a stage's `action` string through this registry, exactly as an
engine is resolved from a definition's `engine` string in `inference.engines`. And exactly as
there, **an action parses its own `config` block** — `core` never knows an action's config
schema, which is what lets a new action ship without touching the reconciler.

Actions that need the outside world take it from `ActionContext.services`, so the pure ones
(`lines.worked_days`, `compute.total`) stay importable and testable with no dependencies at
all. Every side effect in the tier lives under this package.
