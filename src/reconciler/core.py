"""Pure reconciliation core (ADR 0012).

Given a process definition, a cycle, and the milestones recorded for it so far, decide
what to do next and drive it through a `World` port. There is no in-flight state: a run is
a function of what is already recorded, which is what makes the tier crash-safe,
idempotent and re-runnable, and is why the saga problem is *avoided* here rather than
solved — nothing is suspended, so nothing needs a resume token.

**INVARIANT: this module MUST NOT import the runner, an HTTP client, or an LLM SDK.**
Deciding *what* to do is pure logic over recorded events; only *doing* it needs the world,
and that arrives through the `World` protocol below. This is the same seam
`inference.runtime.core` keeps against `quixstreams`, for the same three reasons: the tier
stays testable under CI's bare install, the runner stays swappable (only `flow.py` knows
about Prefect), and the logic stays readable without a transport in the way.

    The loop walks stages in definition order — valid as a topological walk because

    view of milestones that advances as it goes.

    That local advance is not bookkeeping. Without it a run performs exactly one stage,
    because the next stage's `after` is tested against a view that has not moved: a
    seven-stage process would take seven days, and the four `act` stages after approval
    (collect lines, total, render, send) would trickle out one a day instead of completing
    the moment approval lands. It is also why the emit path's latency is irrelevant — a
    milestone reaches Neon through Vector and Kafka, which this run would not see on a
    re-read. The local view is *this* run's truth; Neon is the next run's.
