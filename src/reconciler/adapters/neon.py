"""Reading recorded milestones back out of Neon (ADR 0012).

Neon is the process's state store, and it is already there: Vector persists every raw event
it receives, so a milestone POSTed to the ingest gateway lands in `events` without this tier
owning a table. That is the whole reason the reconciler needs no store of its own — and why
"what state is this process in?" is a query rather than a runtime introspection.

Reads only. Nothing here writes: milestones reach Neon the same way every other event does,
through the gateway (`adapters.gateway`), so the tier never becomes a second writer competing
with the persister.
