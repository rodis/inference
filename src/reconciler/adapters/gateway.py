"""Emitting milestones through the existing ingest gateway (ADR 0012).

The reconciler is a producer like any other: it POSTs to `/sensors/<app>` and Vector does the
rest — mint `message.id`, wrap, produce to `raw_sensors`, persist to Neon. That is normative
rule 1 in practice ("the reconciler acts; Aware observes"): no new topic, no new transform, no
new component, and the milestone is a raw row in Neon exactly like a car door opening.

The contract, from `shape_sensor.yml`:

    POST /sensors/<app>   {"payload": {"event_name": ..., "user_id": ..., ...}}

`event_name` is renamed to `name`; `user_id` is required and events without one are dropped
(with a Vector error log, *not* a 4xx — the HTTP source has already answered 200). So the
absence of an error here does not prove the event landed.
