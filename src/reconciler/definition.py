"""`ProcessDefinition` — a long-running process expressed as data, not code (ADR 0012).

The YAML-on-disk schema (`processes/<name>.yml`) the reconciler loads. Deliberately the
same shape of thing as `inference.runtime.definition.EventDefinition`, one tier up: a
generic runner plus definitions-as-data, so process N+1 is a file rather than a component.

Every stage is one of exactly two kinds — `act` (the reconciler does it and records the
milestone itself) or `await` (it watches for a fact and records when it appears). Resisting
a third kind is a live design constraint, not an accident: see ADR 0012 trip-wires 1 and 7.

Like `engine_config` in the inference tier, a stage's `signal` block is **opaque to the
core** — the finder that resolves it parses its own config, and nothing here knows what a
Gmail matcher looks like.
